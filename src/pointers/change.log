1. Previous version can not be compiled with lcc (pointed by Andrew
   Hutchinson). Now this can be done.

2. Previous version can not be compiled with gcc (pointed by Belinda Thom
   and Michel Beaulieu). Now I hope this can be done.

   Lahtinen). This bug is fixed.

4. I deleted mxx.m and mexme.m files because using them led to some
   problems. Now installation procedure is longer but clearer (I suppose) (see
   contents.m) (thanks to Joe Groner and Jose Suarez)

5. Some things clarifying joint using pointers library and DSATX is added
   to documentation (contents.m) (thanks to Omar Kofahi and Ralph Peters)

6. I repaired subsref.m and subsasgn.m. Christoph Henninger and Gang Liang
   pointed out some bugs in them. Thanks a lot to Gang Liang for helpfull
   suggestions. Now you can use long expressions uncluding pointers subfields
   such as
       a = pointer
       a.data1.data2.data3 = 'abc'
   etc.

7. Memory leak problem pointed out by Christoph Henninger is fixed.

8. Now sub assignment is 2-3 times faster because we have removed some 
   array duplication in mex function.
