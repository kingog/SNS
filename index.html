  Scattering matrices?
  </h1>
  <p>
  Electrical scattering matrices can be used to describe the behavior of
  receiver components. They're very powerful: they can provide a full
  description of the reflection and transmitted waves. Using this
  formalism also allows us to describe the intrinsic noise produced by
  the components in the same framework.
  </p>

  <p>
  The mathematics of finding the response of a connected network of
  components is, unfortunately, not trivial. Luckily, non-trivial
  does not mean impossible. Algorithms for calculating the response of
  an arbitrarily connected network can be derived and implemented by
  hand if you're mad, or in software.
  </p>

  <p>
  SNS is a MATLAB-based implementation of such an algorithm that I
  wrote. I use it mainly for modeling radio/microwave/mm astronomical receivers. What
  makes SNS different from existing freely-available software like
  <a href="http://www.submm.caltech.edu/supermix/default.html">SUPERMIX</a>
  is that the scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components can be
  analytic rather than numeric. This allows you to perform some very
  useful analysis.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  For instance, non-ideal behavior of receiver components can be parameterized in
  their scattering matrices. SNS enables the instrument designer to
  then derive analytic expressions for the signal and noise at the
  receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component imperfections,
  and predict their contribution to receiver systematic errors
  precisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for
  instance, allowing the instrument designer to identify which
  component imperfections contribute most to receiver systematic
  errors, and hence place firm specifications on individual
  components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is preferable to
  traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal
  reflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones
  matrix analysis is unable to describe.

<p>
SNS is very easy to use. Components are modeled as N-port objects, and
connections between ports as nodes. Here is the code snippet which
describes the network shown on the right:
<blockquote> 
<tt>
% Matrices S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and vectors c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 assumed to <br> 
% have been previously defined using symbolic algebra library. <br>
% Make the N-port objects <br>
P1 = makeNport(); P2 = makeNport(); P3 = makeNport();<br>
P4 = makeNport(); P5 = makeNport();<br>
% Assign scattering matrices and noise vectors <br>
P1.S = S1; P2.S = S2; P3.S = S3; P4.S = S4; P5.S = S5;<br>
P1.c = c1; P2.c = c2; P3.c = c3; P4.c = c4; P5.c = c5;<br>
% Make the nodes which connect the N-port objects <br>
In1 = makeNode(); In2 = makeNode(); On1 = makeNode();<br>
On2 = makeNode(); Tn1 = makeNode(); Cn1 = makeNode(); <br>
Cn2 = makeNode(); Cn3 = makeNode();<br>
Cn4 = makeNode(); Cn5 = makeNode();<br>
% Connect nodes to N-ports <br>
connectNode(In1,[],1,P1,1); connectNode(In2,[],1,P1,4);<br>
connectNode(Cn1,P1,2,P3,1); connectNode(Cn2,P1,3,P4,1);<br>
connectNode(Cn3,P3,2,P2,1); connectNode(Cn4,P4,2,P2,4); <br>
connectNode(Cn5,P3,3,P5,1); connectNode(Tn1,P2,3,[],1); <br>
connectNode(On1,P5,2,[],1); connectNode(On2,P2,2,[],1);<br>
% Build arrays of nodes <br>
inputs = {In1 In2}; outputs = {On1 On2}; <br>
cnodes = {Cn1 Cn2 Cn3 Cn4 Cn5}; tnodes = {Tn1};<br>
% Pass arrays of nodes to network calculator <br>
[S, c] = getScatteringRecursive(inputs,outputs,cnodes,tnodes);<br>
</tt><br> 
</blockquote> 
</p>

<p>
The functions <tt>makeNode()</tt>, <tt>makeNport()</tt>,
<tt>connectNode()</tt>, and <tt>getScatteringRecursive()</tt> are all
part of the SNS library. SNS consists of two parts: one part
creates and navigates arbitrarily connected networks of components;
the second part calculates the equivalent scattering matrix and noise
wave vector for the connected network. The matrix <tt>S</tt> and
vector <tt>c</tt> returned by <tt>getScatteringRecursive()</tt>
describe the 4-port device which has the same response as the
connected network, where inputs ports <tt>In1</tt> and <tt>In2</tt>
are connected to ports 1 and 2 respectively, while output ports <tt>On1</tt> and <tt>On2</tt>
are connected to ports 3 and 4 respectively.
